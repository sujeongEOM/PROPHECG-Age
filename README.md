PRediction Of PHenotypes using ElectroCardioGraphy in yonsei-Age
     

# ECG Data processing
- 500Hz / 10 sec / 12 leads
- shape = (5000, 12)
- Use only 8 leads (I, II, V1-V6) as other 4 leads are computed using these 8 leads
- final shape as input = (5120, 8) -> (5000, 8)


# Model Train, Test
- 1D CNN Residual block neural network
